# Twitter Hate Speech Analysis in 2021

## Author: Christopher de la Cruz

## Overview

## Business Problem

According to both the FBI (Federeal Bureau of Investigations) and the Geneva International Center for Justice, both hate crimes and hate speech have been on a significant rise over the past few years. Hate speech is particularly difficult to police and control because unlike most hate crimes, it happens on the internet and can be masked in anonmity much easier. For the purpose of clear communication on this project, we will define hate speech by the definition of the United Nations (UN) which defines it as "any kind of communication in speech, writing or behaviour, that attacks or uses pejorative or discriminatory language with reference to a person or a group on the basis of who they are, in other words, based on their religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, colour, descent, gender or other identity factor." Therefore, telling someone "Fuck you" is offensive but it is not hate speech unless they were told that due to an identification factor. This project seeks to classify specific terms that can highlight hate speech and identify trends and patterns happening in today's world.
